# Alko-logg
A web app for calculating how much alcohol (in shots) a set of alcoholic drinks contain.

The app is entirely customized for Swedish users. This means the language used is Swedish and
all units and formats are the ones used in Sweden.

Hosted with GitHub pages at: [https://www.alko-logg.se](https://www.alko-logg.se/).

You can also browse to [https://alko-logg.se](https://alko-logg.se) (will redirect to www subdomain mentioned above).

## Get started
Just open the index.html file in your web browser.
You don't even need a web server in this case, but it can be handy if you want to auto-refresh the page
when making changes to the code.
